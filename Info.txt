This repo contains an example of exposing a ML Model as an public api .

For this we need to have a account in ngrox , as it needs a valid identity or account to process the public api.

This is a temporary solution to check if our api is working fine or not as till the below code is running 
{
ngrok_tunnel = ngrok.connect(8000)
print('Public URL:', ngrok_tunnel.public_url)
nest_asyncio.apply()
uvicorn.run(app, port=8000)
}

we will have the url working , the moment it closes the url will not work .
